Link: https://msosadesign.github.io/treehouse-project-4/

Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Sass

This is the fourth project in the Treehouse Front-end development Techdegree, meant to test my skills defining a styles guide with sass. It's a mock website with the purpose of testing all the components, colors and fonts of the project. It uses SCSS as syntax and takes advantage of most sass functionalities such as variables, mixins, functions, etc.
